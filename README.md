# price_track
Problem : 
In todays world products are available in many websites and these prices change daily. Due to these complexities it becomes overwhelming for a consumer to take smart decisions about their needs. In order to save users money and make it simple for any user to buy products on eCommerce platforms I have created an application that lets users track there products prices.

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is one of the important topics in software development.

### But what is CI/CD?

CI new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. It’s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other.CD means developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository.

In this project I have tried to use these concepts to built an app that gets data from an eCommerce website daily using CI/CD and the app displays the data pictorially in order to take better decisions about purchasing products.
